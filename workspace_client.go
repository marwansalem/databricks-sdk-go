	// The alerts API can be used to perform CRUD operations on alerts. An alert
	// is a Databricks SQL object that periodically runs a query, evaluates a
	// condition of its result, and notifies one or more users and/or
	// notification destinations if the condition was met. Alerts can be
	// scheduled using the `sql_task` type of the Jobs API, e.g.
	// :method:jobs/create.
	Alerts *sql.AlertsAPI

	// A catalog is the first layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace.
	// It’s used to organize your data assets. Users can see all catalogs on
	// which they have been assigned the USE_CATALOG data permission.
	//
	// In Unity Catalog, admins and data stewards manage users and their access
	// to data centrally across all of the workspaces in a Databricks account.
	// Users in different workspaces can share access to the same data,
	// depending on privileges granted centrally in Unity Catalog.
	Catalogs *catalog.CatalogsAPI

	// Cluster policy limits the ability to configure clusters based on a set of
	// rules. The policy rules limit the attributes or attribute values
	// available for cluster creation. Cluster policies have ACLs that limit
	// their use to specific users and groups.
	//
	// Cluster policies let you limit users to create clusters with prescribed
	// settings, simplify the user interface and enable more users to create
	// their own clusters (by fixing and hiding some values), control cost by
	// limiting per cluster maximum cost (by setting limits on attributes whose
	// values contribute to hourly price).
	//
	// Cluster policy permissions limit which policies a user can select in the
	// Policy drop-down when the user creates a cluster: - A user who has
	// cluster create permission can select the Unrestricted policy and create
	// fully-configurable clusters. - A user who has both cluster create
	// permission and access to cluster policies can select the Unrestricted
	// policy and policies they have access to. - A user that has access to only
	// cluster policies, can select the policies they have access to.
	//
	// If no policies have been created in the workspace, the Policy drop-down
	// does not display.
	//
	// Only admin users can create, edit, and delete policies. Admin users also
	// have access to all policies.
	ClusterPolicies *compute.ClusterPoliciesAPI

	// The Clusters API allows you to create, start, edit, list, terminate, and
	// delete clusters.
	//
	// Databricks maps cluster node instance types to compute units known as
	// DBUs. See the instance type pricing page for a list of the supported
	// instance types and their corresponding DBUs.
	//
	// A Databricks cluster is a set of computation resources and configurations
	// on which you run data engineering, data science, and data analytics
	// workloads, such as production ETL pipelines, streaming analytics, ad-hoc
	// analytics, and machine learning.
	//
	// You run these workloads as a set of commands in a notebook or as an
	// automated job. Databricks makes a distinction between all-purpose
	// clusters and job clusters. You use all-purpose clusters to analyze data
	// collaboratively using interactive notebooks. You use job clusters to run
	// fast and robust automated jobs.
	//
	// You can create an all-purpose cluster using the UI, CLI, or REST API. You
	// can manually terminate and restart an all-purpose cluster. Multiple users
	// can share such clusters to do collaborative interactive analysis.
	//
	// IMPORTANT: Databricks retains cluster configuration information for up to
	// 200 all-purpose clusters terminated in the last 30 days and up to 30 job
	// clusters recently terminated by the job scheduler. To keep an all-purpose
	// cluster configuration even after it has been terminated for more than 30
	// days, an administrator can pin a cluster to the cluster list.
	Clusters *compute.ClustersAPI

	// This API allows executing commands on running clusters.
	CommandExecutor compute.CommandExecutor

	// Connections allow for creating a connection to an external data source.
	//
	// A connection is an abstraction of an external data source that can be
	// connected from Databricks Compute. Creating a connection object is the
	// first step to managing external data sources within Unity Catalog, with
	// the second step being creating a data object (catalog, schema, or table)
	// using the connection. Data objects derived from a connection can be
	// written to or read from similar to other Unity Catalog data objects based
	// on cloud storage. Users may create different types of connections with
	// each connection having a unique set of configuration options to support
	// credential management and other settings.
	Connections *catalog.ConnectionsAPI

	// This API allows retrieving information about currently authenticated user
	// or service principal.
	CurrentUser *iam.CurrentUserAPI

	// In general, there is little need to modify dashboards using the API.
	// However, it can be useful to use dashboard objects to look-up a
	// collection of related query IDs. The API can also be used to duplicate
	// multiple dashboards at once since you can get a dashboard definition with
	// a GET request and then POST it to create a new one. Dashboards can be
	// scheduled using the `sql_task` type of the Jobs API, e.g.
	// :method:jobs/create.
	Dashboards *sql.DashboardsAPI

	// This API is provided to assist you in making new query objects. When
	// creating a query object, you may optionally specify a `data_source_id`
	// for the SQL warehouse against which it will run. If you don't already
	// know the `data_source_id` for your desired SQL warehouse, this API will
	// help you find it.
	//
	// This API does not support searches. It returns the full list of SQL
	// warehouses in your workspace. We advise you to use any text editor, REST
	// client, or `grep` to search the response from this API for the name of
	// your SQL warehouse as it appears in Databricks SQL.
	DataSources *sql.DataSourcesAPI

	// DBFS API makes it simple to interact with various data sources without
	// having to include a users credentials every time to read a file.
	Dbfs *files.DbfsAPI

	// The SQL Permissions API is similar to the endpoints of the
	// :method:permissions/set. However, this exposes only one endpoint, which
	// gets the Access Control List for a given object. You cannot modify any
	// permissions using this API.
	//
	// There are three levels of permission:
	//
	// - `CAN_VIEW`: Allows read-only access
	//
	// - `CAN_RUN`: Allows read access and run access (superset of `CAN_VIEW`)
	//
	// - `CAN_MANAGE`: Allows all actions: read, run, edit, delete, modify
	// permissions (superset of `CAN_RUN`)
	DbsqlPermissions *sql.DbsqlPermissionsAPI

	// Experiments are the primary unit of organization in MLflow; all MLflow
	// runs belong to an experiment. Each experiment lets you visualize, search,
	// and compare runs, as well as download run artifacts or metadata for
	// analysis in other tools. Experiments are maintained in a Databricks
	// hosted MLflow tracking server.
	//
	// Experiments are located in the workspace file tree. You manage
	// experiments using the same tools you use to manage other workspace
	// objects such as folders, notebooks, and libraries.
	Experiments *ml.ExperimentsAPI

	// An external location is an object that combines a cloud storage path with
	// a storage credential that authorizes access to the cloud storage path.
	// Each external location is subject to Unity Catalog access-control
	// policies that control which users and groups can access the credential.
	// If a user does not have access to an external location in Unity Catalog,
	// the request fails and Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to
	// your cloud tenant on the user’s behalf.
	//
	// Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage
	// credentials directly.
	//
	// To create external locations, you must be a metastore admin or a user
	// with the **CREATE_EXTERNAL_LOCATION** privilege.
	ExternalLocations *catalog.ExternalLocationsAPI

	// Functions implement User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in Unity Catalog.
	//
	// The function implementation can be any SQL expression or Query, and it
	// can be invoked wherever a table reference is allowed in a query. In Unity
	// Catalog, a function resides at the same level as a table, so it can be
	// referenced with the form
	// __catalog_name__.__schema_name__.__function_name__.

	GitCredentials *workspace.GitCredentialsAPI

	// The Global Init Scripts API enables Workspace administrators to configure
	// global initialization scripts for their workspace. These scripts run on
	// every node in every cluster in the workspace.
	//
	// **Important:** Existing clusters must be restarted to pick up any changes
	// made to global init scripts. Global init scripts are run in order. If the
	// init script returns with a bad exit code, the Apache Spark container
	// fails to launch and init scripts with later position are skipped. If
	// enough containers fail, the entire cluster fails with a
	// `GLOBAL_INIT_SCRIPT_FAILURE` error code.
	GlobalInitScripts *compute.GlobalInitScriptsAPI

	// In Unity Catalog, data is secure by default. Initially, users have no
	// access to data in a metastore. Access can be granted by either a
	// metastore admin, the owner of an object, or the owner of the catalog or
	// schema that contains the object. Securable objects in Unity Catalog are
	// hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward.
	//
	// Securable objects in Unity Catalog are hierarchical and privileges are
	// inherited downward. This means that granting a privilege on the catalog
	// automatically grants the privilege to all current and future objects
	// within the catalog. Similarly, privileges granted on a schema are
	// inherited by all current and future objects within that schema.
	Grants *catalog.GrantsAPI

	// Groups simplify identity management, making it easier to assign access to
	// Databricks workspace, data, and other securable objects.
	//
	// It is best practice to assign access to workspaces and access-control
	// policies in Unity Catalog to groups, instead of to users individually.
	// All Databricks workspace identities can be assigned as members of groups,
	// and members inherit permissions that are assigned to their group.
	Groups *iam.GroupsAPI

	// Instance Pools API are used to create, edit, delete and list instance
	// pools by using ready-to-use cloud instances which reduces a cluster start
	// and auto-scaling times.
	//
	// Databricks pools reduce cluster start and auto-scaling times by
	// maintaining a set of idle, ready-to-use instances. When a cluster is
	// attached to a pool, cluster nodes are created using the pool’s idle
	// instances. If the pool has no idle instances, the pool expands by
	// allocating a new instance from the instance provider in order to
	// accommodate the cluster’s request. When a cluster releases an instance,
	// it returns to the pool and is free for another cluster to use. Only
	// clusters attached to a pool can use that pool’s idle instances.
	//
	// You can specify a different pool for the driver node and worker nodes, or
	// use the same pool for both.
	//
	// Databricks does not charge DBUs while instances are idle in the pool.
	// Instance provider billing does apply. See pricing.
	InstancePools *compute.InstancePoolsAPI

	// The Instance Profiles API allows admins to add, list, and remove instance
	// profiles that users can launch clusters with. Regular users can list the
	// instance profiles available to them. See [Secure access to S3 buckets]
	// using instance profiles for more information.
	//
	// [Secure access to S3 buckets]: https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/instance-profiles.html
	InstanceProfiles *compute.InstanceProfilesAPI

	// IP Access List enables admins to configure IP access lists.
	//
	// IP access lists affect web application access and REST API access to this
	// workspace only. If the feature is disabled for a workspace, all access is
	// allowed for this workspace. There is support for allow lists (inclusion)
	// and block lists (exclusion).
	//
	// When a connection is attempted: 1. **First, all block lists are
	// checked.** If the connection IP address matches any block list, the
	// connection is rejected. 2. **If the connection was not rejected by block
	// lists**, the IP address is compared with the allow lists.
	//
	// If there is at least one allow list for the workspace, the connection is
	// allowed only if the IP address matches an allow list. If there are no
	// allow lists for the workspace, all IP addresses are allowed.
	//
	// For all allow lists and block lists combined, the workspace supports a
	// maximum of 1000 IP/CIDR values, where one CIDR counts as a single value.
	//
	// After changes to the IP access list feature, it can take a few minutes
	// for changes to take effect.
	IpAccessLists *settings.IpAccessListsAPI

	// The Jobs API allows you to create, edit, and delete jobs.
	//
	// You can use a Databricks job to run a data processing or data analysis
	// task in a Databricks cluster with scalable resources. Your job can
	// consist of a single task or can be a large, multi-task workflow with
	// complex dependencies. Databricks manages the task orchestration, cluster
	// management, monitoring, and error reporting for all of your jobs. You can
	// run your jobs immediately or periodically through an easy-to-use
	// scheduling system. You can implement job tasks using notebooks, JARS,
	// Delta Live Tables pipelines, or Python, Scala, Spark submit, and Java
	// applications.
	//
	// You should never hard code secrets or store them in plain text. Use the

	Jobs *jobs.JobsAPI

	// The Libraries API allows you to install and uninstall libraries and get
	// the status of libraries on a cluster.
	//
	// To make third-party or custom code available to notebooks and jobs
	// running on your clusters, you can install a library. Libraries can be
	// written in Python, Java, Scala, and R. You can upload Java, Scala, and
	// Python libraries and point to external packages in PyPI, Maven, and CRAN
	// repositories.
	//
	// Cluster libraries can be used by all notebooks running on a cluster. You
	// can install a cluster library directly from a public repository such as
	// PyPI or Maven, using a previously installed workspace library, or using
	// an init script.
	//
	// When you install a library on a cluster, a notebook already attached to
	// that cluster will not immediately see the new library. You must first
	// detach and then reattach the notebook to the cluster.
	//
	// When you uninstall a library from a cluster, the library is removed only
	// when you restart the cluster. Until you restart the cluster, the status
	// of the uninstalled library appears as Uninstall pending restart.
	Libraries *compute.LibrariesAPI

	// A metastore is the top-level container of objects in Unity Catalog. It
	// stores data assets (tables and views) and the permissions that govern
	// access to them. Databricks account admins can create metastores and
	// assign them to Databricks workspaces to control which workloads use each
	// metastore. For a workspace to use Unity Catalog, it must have a Unity
	// Catalog metastore attached.
	//
	// Each metastore is configured with a root storage location in a cloud
	// storage account. This storage location is used for metadata and managed
	// tables data.
	//
	// NOTE: This metastore is distinct from the metastore included in
	// Databricks workspaces created before Unity Catalog was released. If your
	// workspace includes a legacy Hive metastore, the data in that metastore is
	// available in a catalog named hive_metastore.

	// The Delta Live Tables API allows you to create, edit, delete, start, and
	// view details about pipelines.
	//
	// Delta Live Tables is a framework for building reliable, maintainable, and
	// testable data processing pipelines. You define the transformations to
	// perform on your data, and Delta Live Tables manages task orchestration,
	// cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling.
	//
	// Instead of defining your data pipelines using a series of separate Apache
	// Spark tasks, Delta Live Tables manages how your data is transformed based
	// on a target schema you define for each processing step. You can also
	// enforce data quality with Delta Live Tables expectations. Expectations
	// allow you to define expected data quality and specify how to handle
	// records that fail those expectations.
	Pipelines *pipelines.PipelinesAPI

	// View available policy families. A policy family contains a policy
	// definition providing best practices for configuring clusters for a

	//
	// Databricks manages and provides policy families for several common

	//
	// Policy families cannot be used directly to create clusters. Instead, you
	// create cluster policies using a policy family. Cluster policies created

	// appear in your cloud account. A serving endpoint can consist of one or
	// more MLflow models from the Databricks Model Registry, called served
	// models. A serving endpoint can have at most ten served models. You can

	// The SQL Statement Execution API manages the execution of arbitrary SQL
	// statements and the fetching of result data.
	//
	// **Release status**
	//
	// This feature is in [Public Preview].
	//
	// **Getting started**
	//
	// We suggest beginning with the [SQL Statement Execution API tutorial].
	//
	// **Overview of statement execution and result fetching**
	//
	// Statement execution begins by issuing a
	// :method:statementexecution/executeStatement request with a valid SQL
	// statement and warehouse ID, along with optional parameters such as the
	// data catalog and output format.
	//
	// When submitting the statement, the call can behave synchronously or
	// asynchronously, based on the `wait_timeout` setting. When set between
	// 5-50 seconds (default: 10) the call behaves synchronously and waits for
	// results up to the specified timeout; when set to `0s`, the call is
	// asynchronous and responds immediately with a statement ID that can be
	// used to poll for status or fetch the results in a separate call.
	//
	// **Call mode: synchronous**
	//
	// In synchronous mode, when statement execution completes within the `wait
	// timeout`, the result data is returned directly in the response. This
	// response will contain `statement_id`, `status`, `manifest`, and `result`
	// fields. The `status` field confirms success whereas the `manifest` field
	// contains the result data column schema and metadata about the result set.
	// The `result` field contains the first chunk of result data according to
	// the specified `disposition`, and links to fetch any remaining chunks.
	//
	// If the execution does not complete before `wait_timeout`, the setting
	// `on_wait_timeout` determines how the system responds.
	//
	// By default, `on_wait_timeout=CONTINUE`, and after reaching
	// `wait_timeout`, a response is returned and statement execution continues
	// asynchronously. The response will contain only `statement_id` and
	// `status` fields, and the caller must now follow the flow described for
	// asynchronous call mode to poll and fetch the result.
	//
	// Alternatively, `on_wait_timeout` can also be set to `CANCEL`; in this
	// case if the timeout is reached before execution completes, the underlying
	// statement execution is canceled, and a `CANCELED` status is returned in
	// the response.
	//
	// **Call mode: asynchronous**
	//
	// In asynchronous mode, or after a timed-out synchronous request continues,
	// a `statement_id` and `status` will be returned. In this case polling
	// :method:statementexecution/getStatement calls are required to fetch the
	// result and metadata.
	//
	// Next, a caller must poll until execution completes (`SUCCEEDED`,
	// `FAILED`, etc.) by issuing :method:statementexecution/getStatement
	// requests for the given `statement_id`.
	//
	// When execution has succeeded, the response will contain `status`,
	// `manifest`, and `result` fields. These fields and the structure are
	// identical to those in the response to a successful synchronous
	// submission. The `result` field will contain the first chunk of result
	// data, either `INLINE` or as `EXTERNAL_LINKS` depending on `disposition`.
	// Additional chunks of result data can be fetched by checking for the
	// presence of the `next_chunk_internal_link` field, and iteratively `GET`
	// those paths until that field is unset: `GET
	// https://$DATABRICKS_HOST/{next_chunk_internal_link}`.
	//
	// **Fetching result data: format and disposition**
	//
	// To specify the result data format, set the `format` field to `JSON_ARRAY`
	// (JSON), `ARROW_STREAM` ([Apache Arrow Columnar]), or `CSV`.
	//
	// You can also configure how to fetch the result data in two different
	// modes by setting the `disposition` field to `INLINE` or `EXTERNAL_LINKS`.
	//
	// The `INLINE` disposition can only be used with the `JSON_ARRAY` format
	// and allows results up to 16 MiB. When a statement executed with `INLINE`
	// disposition exceeds this limit, the execution is aborted, and no result
	// can be fetched.
	//
	// The `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition allows fetching large result sets in
	// `JSON_ARRAY`, `ARROW_STREAM` and `CSV` formats, and with higher
	// throughput.
	//
	// The API uses defaults of `format=JSON_ARRAY` and `disposition=INLINE`.
	// Databricks recommends that you explicit setting the format and the
	// disposition for all production use cases.
	//
	// **Statement response: statement_id, status, manifest, and result**
	//
	// The base call :method:statementexecution/getStatement returns a single
	// response combining `statement_id`, `status`, a result `manifest`, and a
	// `result` data chunk or link, depending on the `disposition`. The
	// `manifest` contains the result schema definition and the result summary
	// metadata. When using `disposition=EXTERNAL_LINKS`, it also contains a
	// full listing of all chunks and their summary metadata.
	//
	// **Use case: small result sets with INLINE + JSON_ARRAY**
	//
	// For flows that generate small and predictable result sets (<= 16 MiB),
	// `INLINE` downloads of `JSON_ARRAY` result data are typically the simplest
	// way to execute and fetch result data.
	//
	// When the result set with `disposition=INLINE` is larger, the result can
	// be transferred in chunks. After receiving the initial chunk with
	// :method:statementexecution/executeStatement or
	// :method:statementexecution/getStatement subsequent calls are required to
	// iteratively fetch each chunk. Each result response contains a link to the
	// next chunk, when there are additional chunks to fetch; it can be found in
	// the field `.next_chunk_internal_link`. This link is an absolute `path` to
	// be joined with your `$DATABRICKS_HOST`, and of the form
	// `/api/2.0/sql/statements/{statement_id}/result/chunks/{chunk_index}`. The
	// next chunk can be fetched by issuing a
	// :method:statementexecution/getStatementResultChunkN request.
	//
	// When using this mode, each chunk may be fetched once, and in order. A
	// chunk without a field `next_chunk_internal_link` indicates the last chunk
	// was reached and all chunks have been fetched from the result set.
	//
	// **Use case: large result sets with EXTERNAL_LINKS + ARROW_STREAM**
	//
	// Using `EXTERNAL_LINKS` to fetch result data in Arrow format allows you to
	// fetch large result sets efficiently. The primary difference from using
	// `INLINE` disposition is that fetched result chunks contain resolved
	// `external_links` URLs, which can be fetched with standard HTTP.
	//
	// **Presigned URLs**
	//
	// External links point to data stored within your workspace's internal
	// DBFS, in the form of a presigned URL. The URLs are valid for only a short
	// period, <= 15 minutes. Alongside each `external_link` is an expiration
	// field indicating the time at which the URL is no longer valid. In
	// `EXTERNAL_LINKS` mode, chunks can be resolved and fetched multiple times
	// and in parallel.
	//
	// ----
	//
	// ### **Warning: We recommend you protect the URLs in the EXTERNAL_LINKS.**
	//
	// When using the EXTERNAL_LINKS disposition, a short-lived pre-signed URL
	// is generated, which the client can use to download the result chunk
	// directly from cloud storage. As the short-lived credential is embedded in
	// a pre-signed URL, this URL should be protected.
	//
	// Since pre-signed URLs are generated with embedded temporary credentials,
	// you need to remove the authorization header from the fetch requests.
	//
	// ----
	//
	// Similar to `INLINE` mode, callers can iterate through the result set, by
	// using the `next_chunk_internal_link` field. Each internal link response
	// will contain an external link to the raw chunk data, and additionally
	// contain the `next_chunk_internal_link` if there are more chunks.
	//
	// Unlike `INLINE` mode, when using `EXTERNAL_LINKS`, chunks may be fetched
	// out of order, and in parallel to achieve higher throughput.
	//
	// **Limits and limitations**
	//
	// Note: All byte limits are calculated based on internal storage metrics
	// and will not match byte counts of actual payloads.
	//
	// - Statements with `disposition=INLINE` are limited to 16 MiB and will
	// abort when this limit is exceeded. - Statements with
	// `disposition=EXTERNAL_LINKS` are limited to 100 GiB. - The maximum query
	// text size is 16 MiB. - Cancelation may silently fail. A successful
	// response from a cancel request indicates that the cancel request was
	// successfully received and sent to the processing engine. However, for
	// example, an outstanding statement may complete execution during signal
	// delivery, with the cancel signal arriving too late to be meaningful.
	// Polling for status until a terminal state is reached is a reliable way to
	// determine the final state. - Wait timeouts are approximate, occur
	// server-side, and cannot account for caller delays, network latency from
	// caller to service, and similarly. - After a statement has been submitted
	// and a statement_id is returned, that statement's status and result will
	// automatically close after either of 2 conditions: - The last result chunk
	// is fetched (or resolved to an external link). - One hour passes with no
	// calls to get the status or fetch the result. Best practice: in
	// asynchronous clients, poll for status regularly (and with backoff) to
	// keep the statement open and alive. - After fetching the last result chunk
	// (including chunk_index=0) the statement is automatically closed.

	StatementExecution *sql.StatementExecutionAPI

	// A storage credential represents an authentication and authorization
	// mechanism for accessing data stored on your cloud tenant. Each storage
	// credential is subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that
	// control which users and groups can access the credential. If a user does
	// not have access to a storage credential in Unity Catalog, the request
	// fails and Unity Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud
	// tenant on the user’s behalf.
	//
	// Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage
	// credentials directly.
	//
	// To create storage credentials, you must be a Databricks account admin.
	// The account admin who creates the storage credential can delegate
	// ownership to another user or group to manage permissions on it.
	StorageCredentials *catalog.StorageCredentialsAPI

	// A system schema is a schema that lives within the system catalog. A
	// system schema may contain information about customer usage of Unity
	// Catalog such as audit-logs, billing-logs, lineage information, etc.
	SystemSchemas *catalog.SystemSchemasAPI

	// Primary key and foreign key constraints encode relationships between
	// fields in tables.
	//
	// Primary and foreign keys are informational only and are not enforced.
	// Foreign keys must reference a primary key in another table. This primary
	// key is the parent constraint of the foreign key and the table this
	// primary key is on is the parent table of the foreign key. Similarly, the
	// foreign key is the child constraint of its referenced primary key; the
	// table of the foreign key is the child table of the primary key.
	//
	// You can declare primary keys and foreign keys as part of the table
	// specification during table creation. You can also add or drop constraints
	// on existing tables.
	TableConstraints *catalog.TableConstraintsAPI

	// A table resides in the third layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level
	// namespace. It contains rows of data. To create a table, users must have
	// CREATE_TABLE and USE_SCHEMA permissions on the schema, and they must have
	// the USE_CATALOG permission on its parent catalog. To query a table, users
	// must have the SELECT permission on the table, and they must have the
	// USE_CATALOG permission on its parent catalog and the USE_SCHEMA
	// permission on its parent schema.
	//
	// A table can be managed or external. From an API perspective, a __VIEW__
	// is a particular kind of table (rather than a managed or external table).
	Tables *catalog.TablesAPI

	// Enables administrators to get all tokens and delete tokens for other
	// users. Admins can either get every token, get a specific token by ID, or
	// get all tokens for a particular user.
	TokenManagement *settings.TokenManagementAPI

	// The Token API allows you to create, list, and revoke tokens that can be
	// used to authenticate and access Databricks REST APIs.
	Tokens *settings.TokensAPI

	// User identities recognized by Databricks and represented by email
	// addresses.
	//
	// Databricks recommends using SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups
	// automatically from your identity provider to your Databricks workspace.
	// SCIM streamlines onboarding a new employee or team by using your identity
	// provider to create users and groups in Databricks workspace and give them
	// the proper level of access. When a user leaves your organization or no
	// longer needs access to Databricks workspace, admins can terminate the
	// user in your identity provider and that user’s account will also be
	// removed from Databricks workspace. This ensures a consistent offboarding
	// process and prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
	Users *iam.UsersAPI

	// Volumes are a Unity Catalog (UC) capability for accessing, storing,
	// governing, organizing and processing files. Use cases include running
	// machine learning on unstructured data such as image, audio, video, or PDF
	// files, organizing data sets during the data exploration stages in data
	// science, working with libraries that require access to the local file
	// system on cluster machines, storing library and config files of arbitrary
	// formats such as .whl or .txt centrally and providing secure access across
	// workspaces to it, or transforming and querying non-tabular data files in
	// ETL.
	Volumes *catalog.VolumesAPI

	// A SQL warehouse is a compute resource that lets you run SQL commands on
	// data objects within Databricks SQL. Compute resources are infrastructure
	// resources that provide processing capabilities in the cloud.
	Warehouses *sql.WarehousesAPI

	// The Workspace API allows you to list, import, export, and delete
	// notebooks and folders.
	//
	// A notebook is a web-based interface to a document that contains runnable
	// code, visualizations, and explanatory text.
	Workspace *workspace.WorkspaceAPI

	// A catalog in Databricks can be configured as __OPEN__ or __ISOLATED__. An
	// __OPEN__ catalog can be accessed from any workspace, while an
	// __ISOLATED__ catalog can only be access from a configured list of
	// workspaces.
	//
	// A catalog's workspace bindings can be configured by a metastore admin or
	// the owner of the catalog.
	WorkspaceBindings *catalog.WorkspaceBindingsAPI

	// This API allows updating known workspace settings for advanced users.
	WorkspaceConf *settings.WorkspaceConfAPI
